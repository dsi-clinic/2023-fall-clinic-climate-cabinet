def calculate_string_similarity(string1: str, string2: str) -> float:
    """Returns how similar two strings are on a scale of 0 to 1

    This version utilizes Jaro-Winkler distance, which is a metric of
    edit distance. Jaro-Winkler specially prioritizes the early
    characters in a string.

    Since the ends of strings are often more valuable in matching names
    and addresses, we reverse the strings before matching them.

    https://github.com/Yomguithereal/talisman/blob/master/src/metrics/jaro-winkler.js

    The exact meaning of the metric is open, but the following must hold true:
    1. equivalent strings must return 1
    2. strings with no similar characters must return 0
    3. strings with higher intuitive similarity must return higher scores

    Args:
        string1: any string
        string2: any string
    Returns:
        similarity score

    Sample Usage:
    >>> calculate_string_similarity("exact match", "exact match")
    1.0
    >>> calculate_string_similarity("aaaaaa", "bbbbbbbbbbb")
    0.0
    >>> similar_score = calculate_string_similarity("very similar", "vary similar")
    >>> different_score = calculate_string_similarity("very similar", "very not close")
    >>> similar_score > different_score
    True

    return float(td.jaro_winkler(string1.lower()[::-1], string2.lower()[::-1]))
