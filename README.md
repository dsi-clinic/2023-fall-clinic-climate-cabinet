## Usage

### Docker

### Docker & Make

We use `docker` and `make` to run our code. There are three built-in `make` commands:

* `make build-only`: This will build the image only. It is useful for testing and making changes to the Dockerfile.
* `make run-notebooks`: This will run a jupyter server which also mounts the current directory into `\program`.
* `make run-interactive`: This will create a container (with the current directory mounted as `\program`) and loads an interactive session. 

The file `Makefile` contains information about about the specific commands that are run using when calling each `make` statement.

### Developing inside a container with VS Code

If you prefer to develop inside a container with VS Code then do the following steps. Note that this works with both regular scripts as well as jupyter notebooks.

1. Open the repository in VS Code
2. At the bottom right a window may appear that says `Folder contains a Dev Container configuration file...`. If it does, select, `Reopen in Container` and you are done. Otherwise proceed to next step. 
3. Click the blue or green rectangle in the bottom left of VS code (should say something like `><` or `>< WSL`). Options should appear in the top center of your screen. Select `Reopen in Container`.




## Repository Structure

### utils
Project python code

### notebooks
Contains short, clean notebooks to demonstrate analysis.

### data

Contains details of acquiring all raw data used in repository. If data is small (<50MB) then it is okay to save it to the repo, making sure to clearly document how to the data is obtained.

If the data is larger than 50MB than you should not add it to the repo and instead document how to get the data in the README.md file in the data directory. 

This [README.md file](/data/README.md) should be kept up to date.

### output
Should contain work product generated by the analysis. Keep in mind that results should (generally) be excluded from the git repository.

## MN Data
### Document and Download MN Campaign Data
- The MN campaign finance data is accessible on [Minnesota Campaign Finance and 
Public Disclosure Board]
(https://cfb.mn.gov/reports-and-data/self-help/data-downloads/campaign-finance/)

- MN campaign data all have csv format. Its data is organized into 3 csv files:
*itemized contributions received of over $200*, 
*itemized general expenditures and contributions made of over $200*, and 
*itemized independent expenditures of over $200*
These csv files have some similar features, but not all the same.
They all individually cover all years (2015-present) as one bulk

- This data source does not have anti-webscraping defenses


### Minnesota Campaign Finance Requirements
- According to [Transparency USA](https://www.transparencyusa.org/mn/races),
MN races included: Attorney General, Governor, Lieutenant Governor, 
District Court, Court of Appeals, House of Representatives, Secretary of State, 
State Auditor, State Senate, Supreme Court. I double checked this list's 
comprehensiveness in  *All registered candidatecommittees* on MN campaign 
finance and public disclosure board

- This dataset covers 2015 to present

- Required to report: With the exception of ballot question political committees 
and funds, those required to file campaign reports with the Board must itemize 
the following within reports filed under Minnesota Statutes section 10A.20:

1. Contributions received from any particular source in excess of $200 within a 
calendar year, each individual contribution should be itemized

2. Expenditures made to any particular individual or association in excess of 
$200 within a calendar year, each individual expenditure should be itemized

3. Contributions made to any principal campaign committee, local candidate 
(seeking one of the offices referenced above within Hennepin County), political 
committee or fund, or political party unit in excess of $200 within a calendar 
year, each individual contribution should be itemized

4. Ballot question political committees and funds similarly must itemize 
contributions received and expenditures made, but their itemization threshold is 
anything over $500, rather than $200

- Limitation:
1. This dataset only covers contributions and expenditures over 200$
2. This dataset only dates back to 2015
3. Both party units and local party units have recipient type PCC and no 
distinguishable subtype

- Additional information: 
1. in-kind: Donations of things other than money are in-kind contributions to 
the receiving entity

2. Type and Subtype Acronym:
    - PCC: Political Contribution Committee
    - PTU: Political Party Unit
    - PCF - Political Committee Fund

    - PF: Political Fund
    - PC: Political Committee
    - PCN: Positive Community Norms
    - PFN: Professional Fundraising Network
    - IEF: Independent Expenditure Fund
    - IEC: Independent Expenditure Committee
    - BC: Ballot Committee

3. Recipient Type and Subtype: 
    - Candidates: Recipient Type PCC 
    - Party Units: Recipient Type PTU
    - State Party Units: Recipient Type PTU, Recipient Subtype SPU
    - Party Unit Caucus Committees: Recipient Type PTU, Recipient subtype CAU
    - Local Party Units: Recipient Type PTU
    - Committees and Funds: Recipient Type PCF, Recipient Subtype PF, PC, PCN, 
    PFN, IEF, IEC, BC
    - Independent Expenditure Committees and Funds: Recipient Type PCF, 
    Recipient Subtype IEF, IE

4. Contributors are categorozed as Candidates, Party units, State party units,
Party unit caucus committees, Local party units, Committees and funds, and
Independent expenditure committees and funds

5. Same contributors whose contribution in total exceed 200 are itemized into
seperate rows/contribution. Contributions from donors who each give $200 or less 
do not need to be itemized, but should be reported as aggregate totals (not 
covered by this dataset by definition). For vendors or suppliers to whom 
expenditures of $200 or less are made, the total amount should be reported 
(itemization unnecessary)
