About the Data - Pennsylvania

Accessibility
- The data comes from the Pennsylvania Government Website’s Full Finance Campaign Report section. To see the actual forms and reports those can be found here: https://www.dos.pa.gov/VotingElections/CandidatesCommittees/FormsReports/Pages/default.aspx

Format
- The data consists of csv files that are broken down into 5 categories: contributions, debt, expenditures, basic filer info, and other receipts. While there is a readme file, it is largely ineffectual since it merely describes some of the data types. A more useful description can be found on the https://www.dos.pa.gov/VotingElections/CandidatesCommittees/CampaignFinance/Resources/Pages/Technical-Specifications.aspx page, which redirects to a page that better details what the data is about. Even then one must consult the filing documentations like the report cover sheet, its various Schedules.
- In 2022 there were changes to the format of the data, including concatenating the name fields (no more separate fields for first, middle and last name), the treasurer’s address fields were removed in the filer document, party codes were updated to be more intuitive, and some more minor adjustments.
